This directory contains historic versions of this game.

The c-version directory contains a buildable, runnable version from just before
the game was translated to Python by ESR in 2006; it's ESR's translation of 
the UT FORTRAN version.

The mayfield.basic file is Mayfield's 1972 version for HP basic, the first
rewrite of his original 1971 game and probably the oldest version still
in existence.

The UT-Trek.basic file is the Grady Hicks version, from 1973.  This code,
or much like it, was what the authors of UT Trek wanted to replace.
