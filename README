# SST-ECON
this is a fork of the original Super Star Trek from gitlab. I have always 
wanted to add economy to the planets and ships and such. so this is that
effort.

README for Super Star Trek 2K

Save the Federation from the invading Klingons!  Visit exotic planets and
strip-mine them for dilithium!  Encounter mysterious space thingies!
This is the classic Super Star Trek game from the days of slow teletypes, 
reloaded.

The game logs user input to /tmp/sst-input.log. If you trip over a bug,
please report it to the maintainers with the log enclosed - that enables
us to reproduce it and rapidly fix the bug.
